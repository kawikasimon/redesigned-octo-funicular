                            <h4>Short Biography</h4>
                        Born in Honolulu, Hawaii where he resided for the past 18 years of his life. He grew up figuratively and literally
                            isolated from the rest of the world. On his free time he decided to 
                         paint and photograph his favorite memories in life. He believed that it was very important to
                        create both digital and physical pieces to remember his past in his future. He values these momentos greatly.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        He is consumed with love in his relationship with his mother and sister; he would do anything for them. His sister was his first volleyball coach
                        while his mother was his forever #1 fan. He decided to attend a college far from home to gain the experience he lacked throughout his childhood,
                        he soon realized how different the culture is here, simply he loves it. He sometimes feels lost without his family, but it's a journey through
                        being an adult.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        He is a current freshman at Concordia University. He is pleased to say that 
                            attending this college was the best choice of his life. He has made many memorable friendships thus far
                            and cannot wait to create new ones. He was also given the opportunity to be a part of the Men's Volleyball team here
                            at Concordia. Although it is a lot of work, it makes him feel excited for the
                            future ahead.
